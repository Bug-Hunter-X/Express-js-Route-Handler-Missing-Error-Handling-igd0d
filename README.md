# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers.  The example shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling, leading to unhelpful error messages for the client and difficulties in debugging.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the flawed route handler.  It fails to properly handle errors that might occur during database operations.  If an error occurs (e.g., the user ID is invalid, the database connection fails), the response to the client is unhelpful, and the server error isn't logged properly.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It incorporates more robust error handling:

- Checks for the existence and validity of `userId`.
- Uses a more descriptive error message for client responses.
- Logs detailed errors to the server console for easier debugging.

This improved error handling provides better feedback for both client and server-side debugging, leading to a more reliable and maintainable application.
